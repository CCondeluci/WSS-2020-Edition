You can have up to 3 different tracklists, one of which will play randomly when music is enabled.

Each tracklist has its own folder, labeled 1-6.

To customize, simple replace "bgm1", "bgm2", and "bgm3" inside a folder with your favorite .mp3 files. 
Make sure to rename your custom files so that each folder still contains:
-bgm1.mp3
-bgm2.mp3
-bgm3.mp3

Ideally, use "perfect loops".
