# Custom Music

You can have 3 different songs for an individual duel. Ideally, these songs will grow in intensity as the duel proceeds on the following timings:

- 0 -> 1
- 1 -> 2
- 2 -> 3

If you're familiar with a certain other _masterful dueling_ game, this probably sounds familiar. Maybe there's music from that game you'd like to import?

Each tracklist has its own folder, labeled 1-6. One of these tracklists will play randomly when a duel begins.

To customize, simple replace "bgm1", "bgm2", and "bgm3" inside each folder with your favorite .mp3 files. Using perfect loops if you can find them helps with smoothing transitions between tracks.

Make sure to rename your custom files so that each folder still contains:

- bgm1.mp3
- bgm2.mp3
- bgm3.mp3

"deck_editor.mp3" is the BGM for the Deck Editor screen. It can also be modified if you wish.
