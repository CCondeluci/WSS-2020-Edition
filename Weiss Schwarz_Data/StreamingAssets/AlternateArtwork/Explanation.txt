Folder for the user to add additional rarities / alternate artwork to a card.  When used in multiplayer, the opponent will see the original artwork unless they have the same mod.

Place files inside a folder with the same name as the set number, for example W40.

File names should be the same as the number within the set of the card you want to copy with exactly 1 letter added to the end. (Number includes letter prefixes like the T in trial deck cards or the P in some promos)  If it doesn't work for an english card try adding E at the start of the name.

Files can be .jpg or .png

For example to add another image to a card with the ID GRI/S72-100 the file would be StreamingAssets/AlternateArtwork/S72/100a.jpg
