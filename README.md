# WSS-2020-Edition

This is a timeboxed modification of the existing [Weiss Schwarz Simulator](https://blakethoennes.itch.io/weiss-schwarz) project exclusively aimed at supporting "Lost" format, an older format of the Weiss Schwarz card game that encapsulates the __English__ metagame _as it stood_ on January 31st, 2021. It has a trimmed-down card database to ensure only cards legal in the format are available for use, as well as a few additional features. 

## Installation

Download the most recent release for your target system from the Releases section to the right, unzip, and enjoy. You __DO NOT__ need to have the simulator already installed; this portable release has everything you need included.

If you are Git-savvy, you can just clone this repository and pull it frequently rather than download a new release every time. This will keep the mod as well as the card database up-to-date.

## Additional Features & Changes

### Sound Effects

Basic sound effects have been added to improve the user experience. To disable them and go back to the silent simulator, simply mute the application from your OS audio mixer.

### Background Music

Both the deck editor and dueling screens now have user-editable background music. To enable/disable background music, use the toggle in the Settings menu. Users can modify the provided royalty-free tracks with whatever MP3 files they would like, provided they follow the provided naming convention. Navigate to the following directory for more information about replacing music files.

### Background Color

The simulator is now blue-coded instead of green. This is to easily differentiate this modification from the official release so that tournament organizers can more easily run events using the modification.

### Separate Decks & Settings

The modification keeps a seperate list of your saved decks and settings, so there won't be any crossover between this mod and the main simulator if you happen to use both.

## Pull Requests

The main goal of creating this modification was to support rapid patch and release functionality, with the goal of eventually having the card database so polished that players are comfortable utilizing the simulator for higher-level play. This will be achieved using GitHub's release feature. Feel free to make pull requests with any fixes for bugs you may find! All contributions are accepted, and any help offered is welcome.
